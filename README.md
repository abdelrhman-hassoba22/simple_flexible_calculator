# Calculator 

**This script is a simple calculator.**

## **Usage:**

To use the script right, you should follow these steps:  
Enter the numbers and operators without spaces, and do not end the line with an operator. Then press enter.  
You will see the result.  
If you want to exit, press `q`,  
or to return to the main interface, press `b`.  

This is the script, simply put.

## **An example:**

- ```bash
  1+2+5+6
  ```
  - ```plaintext
    14
    If you want to quit, press q, or back to main interface, press b
    ```

- ```bash 
  1*5*3
  ```
  - ```plaintext
    15
    If you want to quit, press q, or back to main interface, press b
    ```

### **Why did I follow this method?**

I found some issues with traditional methods, such as using functions. These issues include being limited to the number of operations I define for the user and not being able to include all operations within the script. Additionally, the time it would take to do so is significant. Another problem is restricting the user to a specific number of variables they can input at once in the operation they want to calculate.  

Therefore, I followed this approach to overcome these challenges.
